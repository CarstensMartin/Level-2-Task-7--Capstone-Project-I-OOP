Create a text file with customer details - each line is a new object.
Create a text file with the restaurant order details - each line is a new object.

Create a class for Driver and construct the object.
Create a class for Restaurant Orders and construct the object.
Create a class for Customer and construct the object.

Declare the file paths of Driver text file and store in String.
Declare the file paths of Restaurant Orders text file and store in String.
Declare the file paths of Customer text file and store in String.

Create a Method for scanner(NumberOfLines) to  scan the amount of lines that a text file is to know the array size that needs to be created.

Create a Method for Drivers (ObjectCreationDriver) to create an array using the scanner method - Use (NumberOfLines) method to know array size.
Create a Method for Restaurant Orders (ObjectCreationRestaurant) to create an array using the scanner method - Use (NumberOfLines) method to know array size.
Create a Method for Customer details (ObjectCreationCustomer) to create an array using the scanner method - Use (NumberOfLines) method to know array size.


Build a Prompt system that will ask the user questions in order to add a new order if they want to add a new order.
Build a new array that is 1 size bigger - that captures the existing information and the new information.
Replace the original array with the new bigger array.


FOR LOOP - Loop creates amount of invoices that is in Restaurant Orders array.
	Get order Number from the array position from Restaurant Orders.

	Use a FOR LOOP to run through the customers array see which customer matches the order number.
		Use and IF function to match order number. 
		Also check if the customer can be found matching the order number, else store as no (0) or yes (1).

	Use a FOR LOOP to run though the drivers array.
		Use and IF function to update the driver with the least loads && in the city of the order.
		If no drivers are in the area available drivers = no (0). If available yes (1).


	Now that we have the Array Restaurant Order position, Client array position and Driver position:
	Declare all the String variables that will be needed for the ouput message.

	Create a Method to create the output invoice text(InvoiceDetail) based on the input variables.
	Run the (InvoiceDetail) with the Declared variables to get an Output text message for CORRECT invoice created.

	
	Create an Output message if No driver was found in the area (driverErrorOutputMessage).


	Create method to Create a file (InvoiceFileCreator) with the input variables of:
		- Order Number to add to file name.
		- Text output to be compiled inside text file.
		- Error message if applicable to add to file name).
 	

	IF FORMULA 
		- if the customer is not found matching the order number.
		- Declare error message to be used on invoice.
		- Use (InvoiceFileCreator) to create and error invoice.
		- Display in console that there was a problem with finding the customer.

	ELSE IF - if there is no drivers available in the order area.
		- Use (InvoiceFileCreator) to create and error invoice.
		- Display in console that there was a problem with finding a driver that is available to do the load.
	 
	ELSE 	- Use (InvoiceFileCreator) to create an Invoice that is correct for the client.
		- Display that the invoice was succesfully created.

	
	IF FORMULA
		- If a driver was available in the order area
		- Update the drivers loads array by adding a load to the driver that is delivering the load for this invoice

END of LOOP once all orders are run through.
